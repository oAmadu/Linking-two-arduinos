### Welcome, in this projcet i linked two arduino uno's. 
### and to check that they're connected proberly, i connected a button to one and a LED to the other, Now when i press the button the LED on the other side turns on.
note that the codes are uploaded as .ino files seperated in two folders for each arduino, and the tinkercad project is linked below
